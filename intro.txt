- What is GraphQL?
    - A specification for API query language and server side runtime to execute them
    - Not tied to any specific technology or database
    - Schema: a strong contract between client and server

- GQL VS REST
    - Single smart end point
    - Get what you ask, no over fetching or under fetching
    - Decoupled front-end and back-end, fast development
    - Field level analytics
    - Can be applied on top of existing rest api
